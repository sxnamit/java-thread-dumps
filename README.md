A deep dive on Java Thread Dumps, an invaluable tool to troubleshoot production issues.

#### Thread basics
- Basic unit of scheduling and execution.
- One (method) call stack per thread, or to think of it in reverse, one thread per (method) call stack; consequently each thread will have its own stacktrace.

#### What is thread dump
- Snapshot of all alive threads in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at a particular point in time.
- Captures state and other relevant details of each thread tracked by the JVM, along with its stacktrace (call stack), and bundles them all in a single dump file.

#### How to capture thread dump
1. SIGQUIT (kill -3 <pid>) on Linux, MacOS
    - Built-in, so preferrable
    - Prints thread dump in the stdout of the JVM process (<pid>)
    - Barebones format
    - Command:  
      ps aux| grep '[S]'leepyCallStack| awk '{print $2}'| args kill -3
2. jstack
    - Packaged with JDK; experimental, can be removed in future versions1
    - Prints thread dump in the terminal, so preferrable
    - Command  
    jstack [options] pid  
    jstack spec - https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/jstack.html
3. jcmd
    - Packaged with JDK
    - Prints thread dump in the terminal, so preferrable
    - Command  
    jcmd <pid | main-class> Thread.print [options]  
    jcmd spec - https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/jcmd.html
4. Visual VM
    - Provides a GUI
    - Not packaged with JDK since 9
    - Open source, to be downloaded separately
    - Remote JVM monitoring possible through JMX
5. jconsole
    - Packaged with JDK
    - Provides a GUI
    - Lists threads individually; not in a thread dump
    - Remote monitoring possible
6. Java Mission Control (JMC)
    - Not packaged with JDK since JDK 7 and JDK 8 (7u271 and 8u261)
    - Open source, to be downloaded separately
    - Provides a GUI

##### Note:
To get the pid, you can also use jps tool.  
jps spec - https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/jps.html

#### When to capture thread dump
- Application hangs or freezes
- High CPU or memory usage
- Concurrency issues like stuck threads, deadlocks etc.
- Unexpected errors or exceptions
- Performance testing and tuning (interval captures)
- Integration testing or load testing

#### Thread call stack structure

```
"Garfield" #17 daemon prio=5 os_prio=31 cpu=0.15ms elapsed=3.02s tid=0x000000014e029e00 nid=0x6803 waiting on condition  [0x00000001709ee000]
   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)
    at java.lang.Thread.sleep(java.base@17.0.2/Native Method)
    at com.sxnamit.threaddumps.basics.SleepyCallStack.third(SleepyCallStack.java:36)
    at com.sxnamit.threaddumps.basics.SleepyCallStack.run(SleepyCallStack.java:44)
```
- Thread name ("Garfield")
- Thread ID (#17)
- Indication if the thread is a daemon thread (daemon)
- Thread priority inside JVM (prio=5); JVM platform dependent so not of much use
- Thread priority inside OS (os_prio=31)
- Time thread spent executing on the CPU (cpu=0.15ms)
- Wall clock time passed since the thread was started. (elapsed=3.02s )
- Thread ID, address of the thread structure in memory.(tid=0x000000014e029e00)
- ID of the native thread assigned to the JVM by OS (nid=0x6803)
- Condition part is optional
- Thread state, indicates what the thread was doing at the time thread dump was taken. JVM assigned state, not OS. Correlate with the last method call in the stack trace.
- Thread call stack or stack trace.

##### Note:
Note: Formats could vary between different JVM implementations ([e.g.](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8200720)); we are using Open JDK here. Format also depends on the command used to generate the thread dump. For example, jstack strips the heap report; SIGQUIT doesnâ€™t.

#### Thread states
//TODO  

Let's take a look at some problems that can be troubleshot with thread dumps.
#### Problem 1: Thread leak
A thread leak occurs when an application continuously creates threads but fails to terminate or properly manage them, leading to an accumulation of unused alive threads over time. As these threads accumulate, they consume system resources such as memory, CPU, and thread pool limits, eventually leading to application performance degradation, resource exhaustion or even application crashes.

##### Symptoms of thread leak
- Increased memory usage  
    As more threads are created, the application's memory usage also grows.
- High CPU usage  
    A large number of threads can lead to excessive context switching and CPU usage.
- Application slowness or unresponsiveness  
    The application might become sluggish or unresponsive due to resource exhaustion.
- OutOfMemoryError  
    The JVM might throw an OutOfMemoryError due to the inability to create new native threads.
- Thread exhaustion
    The application might run out of available threads if a fixed-size thread pool is used.

##### Troubleshooting a thread leak using Java thread dumps
- Identify growing number of threads  
  Take multiple thread dumps at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 or 10 minutes) and compare them to see if the number of threads is increasing over time.
- Look for repeated stack traces  
  If you see many threads with identical or very similar stack traces across thread dumps, it may indicate a thread leak. The threads might be stuck in the same method or code block.  
Once the unused threads are identified, it's just a matter of looking at the respective stacktraces and analysing the method and the line of source code where the threads seem stuck.
